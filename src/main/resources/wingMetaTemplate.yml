  # The colour mapper. This is able to map colour ranges in the image to different particles,
  # so you can make a wing consisting of multiple particles.
  # The format is as follows:
  # <start Red>,<start Green>,<start Blue> to <end Red>,<end Grren>,<end Blue> is <particle>
  # A full list of particles can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Particle.html
